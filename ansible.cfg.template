# This file is used to configure Ansible. It is used to set the default
# configuration options for Ansible. It is also used to set the default
# configuration options for the Ansible command line tools.

# Rename this file to ansible.cfg and place it in the same directory as the
# Ansible playbooks. The new "ansible.cfg" file is ignored by Git so it will not be committed
